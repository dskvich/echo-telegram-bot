### Echo telegram bot

## Configuration

### Lambda function creation
* Go to Lambda's web page: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda
* Press Create function on the top right.
* Choose Author from scratch.
* Name your function and choose the Go 1.x runtime.
* Once the function has been created, write main as the function handler.

### API Gateway configuration
* Go to the API Gateway's web page: https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway
* Go to API and choose Create API.
* Choose New API and use a Regional endpoint.
* Click on the newly created API and, from the dropdown Actions menu, choose Create Method.
* Choose the POST method and confirm by pressing on the tick.
* Make sure that Lambda function is selected as the Integration type.
* Make sure that Lambda Proxy Integration is disabled.
* Choose the appropriate region and write name of the function you've created in the Lambda function field.
* Deploy the API by choosing the option from the dropdown menu. This way you'll be given the URL we'll use to set up the bot's webhooks.

## Development

For developers on Windows to create a .zip that will work on AWS Lambda, the `build-lambda-zip` tool may be helpful.

Get the tool
```
go.exe install github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/cmd/build-lambda-zip@latest
```
Then
```
.\buildzip.bat
```

You can now upload the function via the web interface and save the changes.

## Webhook setup

From the Lambda page, get the API Endpoint and from Telegram your bot token.
Perform the appropriate HTTP request.
